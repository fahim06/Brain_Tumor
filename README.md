## üìù Project Overview

This project presents an automated system for identifying brain tumors from MRI images using deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to assist medical professionals in the early and accurate diagnosis of tumors, which is a critical yet challenging task. The study implements and evaluates two prominent models, CNN and VGG-16, to determine the most effective approach for this classification task.

## üí° Motivation

Brain tumors are a significant cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for 85% to 90% of all primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Globally, it was anticipated that 308,102 people would be diagnosed with a primary brain or spinal cord tumor in 2020, with 251,329 deaths expected from the same causes. Early and accurate detection using non-invasive methods like MRI is crucial for effective treatment and improving patient survival rates. This project is motivated by the need for a reliable, automated system that can assist radiologists, reduce human error, and improve the efficiency of brain tumor diagnosis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The methodology follows a structured pipeline from data collection to model evaluation, as illustrated in the flowchart below.


*A placeholder for Figure 3.6.10 from the report* 

1.  **Data Collection**: The dataset was acquired from Kaggle, a platform for data scientists.
2.  **Data Preparation**: This step involved cleaning and filtering the collected image data to make it suitable for the models.
3.  **Data Splitting**: The prepared dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
4.  **Model Implementation**: Two deep learning models were applied:
    * **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A deep learning technique highly effective for image recognition and classification. The architecture involves convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification.
    * **Visual Geometry Group-16 (VGG-16)**: A 16-layer CNN pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, known for its high accuracy in image classification tasks.
5.  **Performance Analysis**: The models were evaluated using a confusion matrix and several key metrics to determine the best-performing algorithm.

## üñºÔ∏è Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset of brain MRI scans collected from Kaggle. The dataset was carefully curated and preprocessed to ensure it was suitable for training and testing the deep learning models.

## üìä Results

The performance of both the CNN and VGG-16 models was rigorously evaluated. The VGG-16 model demonstrated superior performance across most metrics.

| Model Name | Accuracy | Sensitivity | Specificity | Precision | F1-score |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| CNN | 92.02% | **93.64%** | 91.74% | 81.54% | 87.17% |
| **VGG-16** | **95.21%** | 93.22% | **96.02%** | **90.53%** | **91.85%** |
*[Source: Table 4.2.4: Performance evaluation]* 

The VGG-16 model achieved the highest accuracy at **95.21%**, specificity at **96.02%**, precision at **90.53%**, and F1-score at **91.85%**, making it the better-performing model for this dataset.
